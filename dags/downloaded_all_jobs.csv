A criminal history that has a direct, adverse, and negative relationship with these material duties may potentially result in the withdrawal of a conditional offer of employment.

  Department Summary:
 Genentech Research &amp; Early Development (gRED) has initiated an exciting journey to bring together and further strengthen our computational talent and capabilities by forming a new, central organization - gRED Computational Sciences (gCS). gCS is on a mission to partner across the organization to realize the potential of data, technology and computational approaches that will revolutionize how targets and therapeutics are discovered and developed, ultimately enabling novel treatments for patients across the world.
 
 The Computational Catalysts group within gCS is a diverse, curious and action-driven team at the intersection of computation, engineering and science with ambition to advance our technical excellence. The focus of the team is on partnering with the informatics and scientific communities to create a computational and data ecosystem that powers scientific discovery and accelerates decision making. We aim to modernize our ability to acquire, store, link, share, find and analyze data across the organization through scalable and integrated solutions that truly make every data point count
 
  This internship is located in San Francisco, CA, onsite.
 
  How to apply:
  We are asking for a cover letter. In a maximum of one page, double-spaced, please address the following points:
 
  Tell us of a time you explained a policy to someone impacted by it. How did you communicate it, and what was the result? An example could be explaining the membership policy of an organization/facility to prospective members.
  Explain how you see this internship aligning with your personal, educational and/or career goals.
  (Optional, if you have a computational background) If you have previously used a computational approach to solve a problem, please describe it. What was the problem? What techniques and scripting languages did you use? What was the impact of your analysis?
 
 
  The Opportunity:
 We are seeking a Data Policy &amp; Communications Intern to develop informational materials for scientists within Roche regarding data usage policies and processes. A primary level of responsibility will be to communicate extensively with data managers and scientists to understand how they are viewing and understanding our current guidance materials, and to revise their format and method of delivery to match user needs. A secondary role in the internship (under the same hiring manager) is to develop user guides for a new data transfer tool and reorganize existing documentation to address specific queries users make. Depending on technical skills and interest, the intern may also participate in preparing datasets for internal reuse and collaboration.
 
 Key Responsibilities
 
  Analysis of data sharing requests for advice to identify trends in queries and develop informational materials.
  Communication with Roche data sharing policy experts to seek advice when advisory materials are unclear.
  Communication with teammates via Slack / Google Chat / meetings to discuss proposals and review materials.
  Communication with data providers and scientists, via email and in meetings, to discuss materials and understand and answer their queries.
  Preparation of informational materials describing best practices and processes for using data.
  (Optional) If the intern has a background in data analysis and requisite technical skills, they may participate in dataset preparation. This is not a requirement of the position, and it is highly dependent on prior experience and internal needs.
 
 
  Program Highlights:
 
  Intensive 12-week full-time (40 hours per week) paid internship.
  Program start dates are in May/June, preferably in May(Summer).
  The candidate must be able to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area to work on-site in the South San Francisco, California Genentech Campus.
  A stipend will be provided to help alleviate costs associated with the internship.

  Who You Are
 
  Required Education: Must be pursuing a PhD (enrolled student).
 
 
  Required Majors: International affairs, public policy, business, biology, chemistry, or similar programs.
 
  PhD students must be within the first two years of their program.
  Will have completed at least two years of undergraduate coursework at an accredited college/university.

 AND OUR 3RD PILLAR IS Expanding Digital Services
 
  More hybrid workforce and more time spent on digital platforms gaming, shopping, connecting = more need for services.
  We are uniquely placed to help IT with combo across HP (PC &amp; Print)
  Can help them tackle the pain points of a remote workforce – onboarding, productivity, remote computing – we acquired Teradici.
  All OF THIS IS Supported by Security and Sustainability
